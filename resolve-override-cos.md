# Resolve Override with COS
{: #resolve-override-cos}

This section offers use cases in resolving overrides with Cloud Object Storage.
{: shortdesc}

## Use cases
{: #cos-use-cases}

Make the request matching the page rule resolve to a Cloud Object Storage (COS) bucket resource.


## Prerequisites
{: #cos-prerequisites}

The following steps assume you have an existing COS instance and bucket with public access. For information on public access see [Allowing public access](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-iam-public-access).

## Create Page Rule steps
{: #cos-create-page-rule}

* Navigate to **Performance->Page Rules**.
* Click **Create rule** button.
* Input the desired value for URL match. For example, `*.foo.com/*`.
  * Note that the URL match must match your COS object name.
  * For example, if you have an object called reports.txt under the bucket `my-bucket1`, then both of these URL matches would be valid:
    * `*.foo.com/*`
    * `*.foo.com/reports.txt`
* Use the list menu to select **Resolve Override with COS** under the **Performance** section.
* Use the **Cloud Object Storage Instance** list to select the desired instance.
* Use the **Bucket** list to select the desired bucket.
* To create the Page Rule click the **Provision 1 Resource** button.


## Detailed explanation of concepts
{: #cos-detail-concepts}

When creating a **Resolve Override with COS** page rule, CIS will automatically create the other necessary resources for the COS integration. These include:

**CNAME**
* A CNAME DNS record for `<bucket-name>.<cos-endpoint>` as `<bucket-name>`.
* For example, if your CIS domain is `foo.com`, you have a COS bucket called `images` and your public COS endpoint is `s3.us-west.objectstorage.uat.test.net` then CIS will create a CNAME as `images.foo.com` that points to `images.s3.us-west.objectstorage.uat.test.net`.
If the Resolve Override with COS page rule is no longer needed the CNAME should be manually deleted along with the page rule.
{:note}

**Host Header Override**
* The Host Header Override setting will replace the host header for the URI matching the page rule to `<bucket-name>.<cos-endpoint>`.
* Using the previous example, the Host Header Override value will be set to `images.s3.us-west.objectstorage.uat.test.net`.

## Proxy DNS entries are required for domains that are to be matched by the page rule
To perform the actual rewrite and redirecton to the COS bucket the domains to be used with this page rule, such as `www.foo.com` must have DNS entries in CIS with the 'proxy' flag set.  See [Proxying DNS Records](/docs/infrastructure/cis?topic=cis-dns-concepts#dns-concepts-proxying-dns-records) for more information.  If all requests to `www.foo.com` are to be redirected than a CNAME entry that points to `<bucket-name>` with proxy enabled will be sufficient.

## Deleting the Page Rule
{: #cos-delete-page-rule}

If the Resolve Override with COS page rule is no longer needed, the CNAME should be _manually_ deleted along with the page rule.


## Editing the Page Rule
{: #cos-edit-page-rule}

After editing the page rule, the **Resolve Override with COS** will no longer be displayed on the page. However, the **Resolve Override** `<bucket>.<domain>` and **Host Header Override** `<bucket>.<cos-endpoint>` will replace **Resolve Override with COS**.

Making changes to the **Resolve Override** will _not_ automatically create a new CNAME record (for example, `<updated-bucket>.<domain>`). This is only done upon the initial creation of a page rule using **Resolve Override with COS**. To automatically create the CNAME record for the bucket follow the [Create Page Rule](#cos-create-page-rule) steps.
